# NativePHP Build Action

Community GitHub Action for building NativePHP Mobile Android applications directly on GitHub-hosted runners.

This is an independent, open-source project. It uses NativePHP's official CLI and does not replace NativePHP or Bifrost.

## Quick start

NativePHP Mobile 4's release packaging requires Android signing credentials. Store the keystore as a base64-encoded GitHub Secret. Development APKs can use `build-type: debug`, which generates a temporary keystore on the runner and does not require signing secrets.

```yaml
name: Build Android

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build NativePHP Android APK
        id: build
        uses: mrpunyapal/nativephp-build-action@v1
        with:
          platform: android
          build-type: release
          keystore: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64 }}
          keystore-password: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD }}
          key-alias: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS }}
          key-password: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD }}

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: nativephp-android-apk
          path: ${{ steps.build.outputs.artifact }}
```

For a development APK without signing secrets, use `build-type: debug`. For a Play Store bundle, use `build-type: bundle`. The bundle output is an `.aab` instead of an `.apk`.

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `platform` | `android` | Target platform. |
| `build-type` | `release` | `debug` produces a temporary-key development APK; `release` produces a signed APK; `bundle` produces a signed AAB. |
| `working-directory` | `.` | Laravel application directory. |
| `php-version` | `8.4` | PHP version. |
| `node-version` | `22` | Node.js version. |
| `java-version` | `17` | Java version used by Gradle. |
| `android-api-level` | `36` | Android platform SDK. |
| `android-build-tools` | `36.0.0` | Android build-tools package. |
| `android-ndk` | `27.0.12077973` | NDK used by the NativePHP Android template. |
| `keystore` | — | Base64-encoded JKS/keystore content. Required for release and bundle builds. |
| `keystore-password` | — | Keystore password. |
| `key-alias` | — | Signing key alias. |
| `key-password` | — | Signing key password. |
| `google-services-json` | — | Base64-encoded `google-services.json` content (Firebase Android config). |
| `google-services-json-path` | `resources/google-services.json` | Destination path, relative to `working-directory`, for the decoded file. |
| `google-service-info-plist` | — | Base64-encoded `GoogleService-Info.plist` content (Firebase iOS config). |
| `google-service-info-plist-path` | `resources/GoogleService-Info.plist` | Destination path, relative to `working-directory`, for the decoded file. |

## Outputs

`artifact` is the absolute path to exactly one generated `.apk` or `.aab`. The Action fails if the expected artifact is missing or ambiguous.

## Signing

Create or export the keystore locally, then encode it without line wrapping:

```bash
base64 -w 0 pinkary.keystore > pinkary.keystore.base64
```

Save the encoded contents as `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` and save the three passwords/aliases as separate GitHub Secrets. The Action writes the keystore only to the runner's temporary directory, passes the path through NativePHP's supported environment variables, and removes it in an `always()` cleanup step.

Do not print the secret, pass it in a command string, or commit the keystore.

## Firebase configuration (google-services.json / GoogleService-Info.plist)

If your app uses a Firebase-backed plugin (such as [`nativephp/mobile-firebase`](https://nativephp.com/plugins/nativephp/mobile-firebase)), it needs `google-services.json` and/or `GoogleService-Info.plist` at build time. Never commit these files — they contain your Firebase project's client configuration. Instead, base64-encode them and store them as GitHub Secrets, the same way as the signing keystore:

```bash
base64 google-services.json | tr -d '\n' > google-services.json.base64
base64 GoogleService-Info.plist | tr -d '\n' > GoogleService-Info.plist.base64
```

Save the encoded contents as `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` and `GOOGLE_SERVICE_INFO_PLIST` GitHub Secrets, then pass them to the Action:

```yaml
      - name: Build NativePHP Android APK
        id: build
        uses: mrpunyapal/nativephp-build-action@v1
        with:
          platform: android
          build-type: release
          keystore: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64 }}
          keystore-password: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD }}
          key-alias: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS }}
          key-password: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD }}
          google-services-json: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON }}
```

For an iOS build (`platform: ios`), pass `google-service-info-plist: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_SERVICE_INFO_PLIST }}` alongside the `ios-*` signing inputs instead.

The Action decodes each provided secret into `google-services-json-path` / `google-service-info-plist-path` (default `resources/google-services.json` and `resources/GoogleService-Info.plist`, relative to `working-directory`) before `native:install` runs, so NativePHP's asset-copy step can place them into the native Android/iOS projects. These defaults already match NativePHP's plugin `assets` convention and work for both platforms without changes — override the `*-path` inputs only if your Firebase plugin's manifest expects the source file somewhere other than `resources/`. Both files are deleted from the checkout in an `always()` cleanup step after the build, and add the same paths to your app's `.gitignore` so a locally-decoded copy never gets committed by accident.

## What the Action does

1. Validates the Android build and signing inputs.
2. Restores Composer, npm, and Android Gradle caches when available.
3. Installs PHP, Composer, Node.js, Java, Android SDK, CMake, and the NativePHP-required NDK.
3. Installs Composer/npm dependencies and builds frontend assets when the project defines a build script.
4. Runs `php artisan native:install android`.
5. Runs `php artisan native:package android --build-type=... --no-tty`.
6. Locates and exposes the generated artifact.

The underlying Composer, NativePHP, and Gradle output remains visible in the workflow log.

## Tested application and requirements

The first integration target is the Pinkary NativePHP application. Its current requirements are PHP `^8.4`, Laravel `13.17+`, Node.js `22`, npm, NativePHP Mobile `4.4`, Java `17`, Android API `36`, CMake `3.22.1`, and NDK `27.0.12077973`.

The Action is designed for `ubuntu-latest`. Android release and bundle packaging require a signing keystore because NativePHP's `native:package` command creates signed distribution artifacts. Debug mode creates a short-lived development keystore inside the runner.

## Limitations

- No Play Store or App Store publishing.
- No hosted build service, dashboard, or billing.
- A GitHub-hosted release/bundle integration run needs a pushed application repository with signing secrets.
